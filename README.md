# GETogether
GETogether is a state-of-the-art dynamic web application that allows users to create or search local events around them. GETogether is the newest site for meeting people around you in a very different way. We decided to connect people through common interests, not just silly bios like on apps and sites. Want to hit the bike trails for a cycling adventure? We have events for that! Want to do a virtual wine tasting with some new people and broaden your tastebuds horizons? Set one up and get started! The events you can create and attend are only limited by ones imagination. If it is something that interests you and you think would be fun to share with others, then create it! If you are new in an area and want to meet people, or if you are someone who just wants to try something new, then take a look at what GETogether has to offer.  We hope that our passion of connecting the world together through common interests will help spark some new passions in your own life!
